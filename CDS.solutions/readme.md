# Microsoft Dynamics Accelerator

This repository represents the solution for AppSource, to support both side loading and enabling release updates to AppSource

# Requirements

You will need a full CDS / Customer Engagement v9.0 or greater Dynamics 365 instance. For some examples you will also need a Power BI / Power BI Pro LICENSE and possibly a Microsoft Azure subscription for some of the AI and AAD examples.

# Solution Updates

We will be applying updates and releases to the Accelerator solution and sample data in GIT before we release it to AppSource. Folks can side load the updates and provide feedback. Once we are ready for a release we will lock and then release. We have not decided on the release cadence yet but look for updates in GIT happening frequently.
